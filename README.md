  # README Generator
  ## Description
  Generate a README file using the command line and user input. The program will prompt the user to provide a title, description, usage, testing, installation, contribution, license, and questions. Responses are taken and inserted into a README file, their email and GitHub accounts are linked, and the program will place a license button at the top of the README.
